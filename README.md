# Student Exam Score Prediction using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting student exam scores by analyzing various academic and behavioral factors. Using a Linear Regression approach, the study aims to identify the relationship between study habits and final academic performance.

## Project Overview
The objective of this research is to build a predictive model that estimates exam scores based on a dataset of student metrics. The project covers the entire machine learning pipeline, from data cleaning to model evaluation.

* **Data Analysis:** Exploration of the student exam scores dataset to identify correlations between variables.
* **Feature Engineering:** Selection and preprocessing of independent variables such as study hours to improve prediction accuracy.
* **Modeling:** Implementation of a Linear Regression algorithm to establish a mathematical relationship between features and target scores.

## Methodology
The implementation follows a structured data science workflow:
1. **Data Loading:** Importing the student score dataset using the Pandas library.
2. **Visualization:** Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot regression lines and distribution of scores.
3. **Training:** Splitting data into training and testing sets to validate model performance.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing the model using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Tool:** Jupyter Notebook

## Repository Structure
* `student_exam_scores.csv`: The raw dataset containing student academic information.
* `HomeWork_2.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the data analysis and regression model.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the utility of linear regression in predicting academic outcomes and provides insights into the factors that most significantly impact student success.
